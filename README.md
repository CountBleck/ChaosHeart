# ChaosHeart
A terribly designed Electron app for ruining Discord servers.

There is no prebuilt installer, as this app should never be used,
for it is poorly designed. Instead, you have to clone it manually,
install its dependencies, and run it with `electron-forge start`.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CountBleck/ChaosHeart
yarn # or npm i
yarn start # or npm start
```

## Notes
The app only works with bot accounts (too lazy to add selfbot support).
Moreover, the app unnecessarily uses React Router, since I was planning
to add more features to it. However, **I am not adding features to this, as this
project has no hope in being useful or successful.** In the future, perhaps I
will make a better application that supports a wider variety of raiding use-cases.

**You should never use this app under any circumstances.**
**Do not expect any support for this project in any way whatsoever.**
